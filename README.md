**Description (1 paragraph):**

In this day and age a lot of people are starting to get into fasting on the daily bases and trying different ways to fast, either to lose weight, body train, or for their religion. FastTrack is an app where the user can log what kind of fast they are going to complete, how many calories a day, and what they will be eating. FastTrack will also give the user different types of fasting and religious fasting.
